# Notes

The purpose of this repository is to organize my thoughts on what I read
and provide links so I can find it again. The act of writing also helps me
understand and remember. I will record thoughts as I have them. They may
be wildly inaccurate. Indeed, I will strive to be as flagrantly wrong as
possible.

I shall also try to be content, rather than strucutre, oriented. I love to
write TODO lists and outlines. But they do little to tame my random
approach to learning. Here I will curate content I have added, but never
outline what I haven't. Or so I say, but I lie.

The entry point for new ideas will be atomic notes, single files describing
thoughs on one paper or idea. Later I may organize these. But I want there to
be no barriers to new submissions.
